Vibrant Gem
===========

This is Vibrant Gem, a TextMate theme based (HEAVILY) on Vibrant Ink (and forked from Vibrant Fin).

While I like Vibrant Ink, and like Vibrant Fin better (some of the colors aren't quite as bright and in your face), both seemed to be missing quite a bit when it came to programming in Ruby and some other languages (at least when used with Sublime Text 2).

Both of the previous Vibrants seemed to be missing coloring for instance variables (`@name`), classes in pretty much all cases (declaration, inheritance, and static usage), and operators, to name a few.

Furthermore, none of them had any coloring schema for XML documents.

*Vibrant Gem* is my attempt to improve the experience of reading and writing Ruby in Sublime Text 2.
